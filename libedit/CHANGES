	* Fix order of weak_extern
	* Don't hard-code the path for awk
	* Eliminate one more u_int32_t

2003-03-09 : Christos Zoulas <christos@netbsd.org>
	* More fixes from the NetBSD tree
	  - unique history
	  - The posix 'sh' specification defines vi-mode editing quite tightly.
	    The netbsd libedit code (used by sh to do this) was missing several
	    features, there were also minor errors in others.

	    Compare netbsd sh to the definition available from:
	    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/utilities/sh.html
	    In particular the following were not supported:
		    U - undo all changes to line
		    | - goto column
		    Y - yank to end of line
		    y - yank
		    # - comment out current line
		    @ - take input from shell alias [1]
		    G - goto numbered line in history buffer
		    v - edit history line with vi
		    _ - append word from last input line
		    . - redo last command
	    Other minor changes have also been made.

	    [1] This needs the shell to define an appropriate routine to
	    return the text of the alias.  There is no requirement that
	    such a function exist.

2003-03-09 : Michael Haardt <michael@moria.de>
        * Fix configure.in for autoconf 2.57
        * Fix never closed file descriptor after completion
        * Changes to compile with Solaris 9
        * Changes to compile static library on HP-UX 10.20 (dynamic fails)
        * Optional unique history feature backported from editline 1.5
        * Remove config.cache during distclean

2002-02-25 : Christos Zoulas <christos@netbsd.org>
	* Bring in constification fixes from NetBSD tree.
	* Use NetBSD's vis, fgetln

2002-02-10 : Jason Evans <jasone@freebsd.org>
	* Makefile.in : Append "" arguments to for loops, to avoid syntax errors
          with some shells that occur if there are no arguments to the for
          loops.

2002-02-09 : Jason Evans <jasone@freebsd.org>
	* Install man pages in @prefix@/man/, rather than @prefix@/share/man.

	* Fix the Darwin -install_name S_LDFLAGS argument to default to a prefix
          of /usr/local if --prefix is not specified.

2002-02-05 : Jason Evans <jasone@freebsd.org>
	* Convert to using an autoconf-generated config.h, rather than passing
	  -D_HAVE_<foo>=1 definitions on the command line.  Include sys.h in
	  config.h, and include config.h in .c files rather than sys.h.

	* Mangle function names for implementations in the np directory in order
          to avoid namespace collisions with other code that may provide copies
          of the same unimplemented functions.  For example:

		#define	fgetln libedit_fgetln

2002-02-03 : Jason Evans <jasone@freebsd.org>
	* Add autoconf infrastructure, plus a generic Makefile that works with
          at least BSD make, GNU make and Sun make.

	* Port and/or test on FreeBSD 4.5, FreeBSD-current, NetBSD 1.5 (sparc64
          and arm32), Apple OS X 10.1.2, Solaris 2.6, and Red Hat Linux 2.6.
          Add the np directory, which contains implementations of non-portable
          functions.

	* Add the LIBEDIT_MAJOR and LIBEDIT_MINOR macros to histedit.h, since
          there is otherwise no straightforward method of programmatically
          detecting the library version.
